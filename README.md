Procedural Terrain Generation in Unity3D

Overview
This project is focused on generating procedural terrains for Unity3D, which can be used in various types of games, especially open-world or sandbox games. The system allows for the creation of diverse and realistic landscapes by using noise functions and other procedural techniques.

Features
Noise-based Terrain Generation: Utilize Perlin noise, Simplex noise, or custom noise functions to create varied and natural-looking terrains.
Customizable Parameters: Adjust parameters like terrain height, frequency, amplitude, and scale to generate different types of landscapes.
Random Seed Support: Generate unique terrains each time or use a specific seed to recreate the same terrain.
Terrain Modification Tools: Tools for flattening areas, adding hills, valleys, and other features post-generation.
Integration with Unity Terrain System: Seamless integration with Unity's built-in terrain system, supporting all standard terrain features such as textures, trees, and details.
